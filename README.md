# MSc in Data Analytics GitHub Account üñ•Ô∏è 

## CCT College Dublin, Ireland üéì 
Welcome to the **MSc Data Analytics GitHub repository**, dedicated exclusively to showcasing the projects, code, and materials I have used and developed during my Master of Science in Data Analytics at **CCT College Dublin**. The program commenced in September 2023 and concluded in October 2024. This repository highlights my academic journey, the technical skills gained, and the applied research undertaken throughout the program.

## About the Program üìò
The MSc in Data Analytics at **CCT College Dublin** is a structured program designed to equip graduates with advanced tools, techniques, and methodologies to analyze, interpret, and visualize data effectively. The program spans three semesters:  

- **Semester 1:** Focused on foundational subjects to build core competencies in machine learning, data preparation, statistics, and programming.  
- **Semester 2:** Advanced subjects explored big data storage, processing, and data analysis, along with research and professional ethics.  
- **Semester 3:** Dedicated entirely to a capstone project titled *"Federated Learning: Evaluating Popular Frameworks and Developing a Cross-Client Horizontal Server."* This project focused on bridging the gap between academic Federated Learning (FL) frameworks and real-world FL systems. The research involved building a horizontal FL server for binary classification and image classification tasks, demonstrating improvements in accuracy for non-IID data scenarios while highlighting challenges such as communication issues and infrastructure limitations.
